    <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
    <h1>This is our story...</h1>
    <p class="story">In a world where many young minds feel unheard, The Mind Bridge was born a safe space to connect youth with the understanding
        ,support, and awareness they deserve. We believe mental health isn't a taboo; it's a conversation that builds strength. 
        Through open talks, creative workshops, and community outreach, we're  bringing  the gap between silence and healing one young 
        mind at a time.
        We the Mind Bridge community, started this platform to aid with mental health challenges. We started as a university
        club, and we served as a community that helped and supported fellow youths to overcome mental health challenges, e.g
        depression,heartbreak, and addiction, through dailogues and workshops, providing accountability partners and financial
        support.
